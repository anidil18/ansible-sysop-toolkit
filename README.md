In addition - role for install mactelnet server.

Plans
-----------
Add roles for install

- NextCloud service
- MySQL service
- PostgreSQL service
- OpenSSL based PKI
- Install base-line utilit's on new servers

Requirements
------------

This role requires Ansible 1.4 or higher, and platform requirements are listed
in the metadata file.

Command examples:

		ansible-playbook -vvv -i mint-hosts/inventory aws-create-windows-instance.yml --limit=localhost --ask-vault-pass

								or

                ansible-playbook -vvv -i mint-hosts/inventory mactelnet-server.yml --ask-vault-pass

NB
roles ssh-client-forward and ssh-server-forward need credanses to access to remoute host "remoute_login_ip" with account "remoute_login"
